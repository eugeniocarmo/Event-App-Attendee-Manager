<h1>Event-App Attendee Manager</h1>
<p><br /> The Event-App Attendee Manager is a simple mobile application built with React Native that allows users to manage the attendees or participants for an event. Users can add or remove attendees as needed, and the app will prevent the addition of duplicate names. Note, the app&nbsp;does not include the ability to set and modify the event title and date. </p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use the Event-App Attendee Manager, you will need to have a React Native development environment set up on your machine. Once you have set up your environment, follow these steps:</p>

<li>Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.</li>
<li>Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.</li>
<li>Run npm start to start the app.</li>
<li>Use the Expo app on your mobile device to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the app is running on your mobile device, you can add and remove attendees as described in the previous README. </p>
